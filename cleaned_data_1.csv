 Planning Process Review The Purpose of this guide is to prepare project proponents for the review and processing of various development applications within the City of Lomita. It is made available to the public for reference, as a summary of code requirements and explanation of planning terms and processes. 
 The information provided herein is consistent with the General Plan of the City of Lomita, the current Zoning Code, the California State Subdivision Map Act, and all other applicable state, county and local ordinances, policies and regulations. 
 Review Process Ministerial Approval: Staff Review 
 Prior to obtaining a building permit, projects that entail construction or modifications to existing structures, including construction of fences, new windows, and solar installations, must undergo an administrative (staff level) site plan review to verify the project’s compliance with the City’s required development standards. 
 A member of the Planning Division staff will be assigned as the case planner for the project upon an application’s submission. The case planner will review the project for compliance with applicable development standards and will collect an administrative review fee from the applicant; the review fee is waived for solar panel projects. Projects that require minor corrections will be provided a list of revisions necessary to make the project code compliant. The applicant will be issued an approval letter once any necessary revisions are made and the case planner determines that the project adheres to all applicable development standards. The planner will also stamp plans submitted with the application. 
 Upon receiving administrative approval the applicant must submit two complete sets of plans to the Los Angeles County Department of Building and Safety for plan check. A complete set of plans includes a site plan, structural plan, floor plans, and elevations. Building and Safety staff will inform the applicant if additional plans or sets of plans are required. 
 Plan check fees are collected at the time of submission and are based on the valuation of the project, but include school tax and other fees. Plans are reviewed for expansive soil conditions, seismic resistance requirements, and energy saving measures, as well as other Building and Safety requirements. After any required modifications to the plans are made; a building permit is issued. 
 Discretionary Approval: Planning Commission Review 
 If the administrative review shows that a project does not meet code requirements or requires discretionary review per the Lomita Zoning Code, the project will need entitlement approval from the Planning Commission and possibly the City Council depending on the entitlement(s) requested prior to obtaining a building permit. Planning Commission approval is also required for discretionary planning applications, including but not limited to; zone change, and conditional use permit applications. 
 A member of the Planning Division staff will be assigned as the case planner for the project. The case planner will provide the applicant a list of required supplemental materials be submitted with their application, such as plans, elevations, site surveys, etc. After an application is determined complete for processing, the case planner will prepare and present a report to the Commission recommending approval or denial of the project. 
 Development Advisory Committee 
 The case planner will schedule the project for review and discussion by the Development Advisory Committee (DAC). The DAC meets on the second Tuesday of each month and provides a coordinated review of development proposals with regard to the City Code, goals, policies, and standards. The purpose of the meeting is to review the proposed project and identify any issues requiring special attention or revision. 
 The DAC is comprised of the following representatives, forming the core group: Principal Planner, City Engineer, Los Angeles County Sheriff Deputy, and Assistant City Manager. As necessary or as requested, additional members may be requested to attend the meeting to provide specialized review. 
An applicant’s responsiveness to the DAC’s comments and concerns will help to expedite the project through this step of the planning process. If necessary, DAC members may meet individually with applicants to resolve technical issues. Such meetings should be coordinated with the case planner. 
 Once all issues have been addressed by the DAC and the applicant has submitted all necessary materials, the case planner will prepare the staff report which includes a project recommendation and schedule the project for a public hearing for Planning Commission review. 
 Planning Commission Hearing 
 A public hearing requires notification of surrounding property owners and allows for opposing arguments to be heard. The procedures necessary to schedule a public hearing are detailed in the appropriate instructions. The Lomita Planning Commission meets on the second Monday of each month. Plans must be deemed complete by the assigned case planner prior to scheduling the item to appear before the Planning Commission. After the case planner presents the project’s staff report, the applicant, as well anyone in attendance at the hearing, will be given the opportunity to address the Commission regarding the project. The Planning Commission may then approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed project. For approvals such as tentative maps and legislative amendments, the Planning Commission will make a recommendation to the City Council for final approval, approval with conditions, or denial. 
 Appeals / City Council Review 
 If an applicant is dissatisfied with the Planning Commission’s decision it may be appealed to City Council. The decision of the City Council upon an appeal from an action of the commission is final and conclusive.

 Stormwater Management 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Stormwater Management Melanie Moore 2024-01-22T10:32:11-08:00 
 
 Stormwater – Watershed Lomita is part of the Dominguez Channel Watershed Group. Runoff and stormwater in Lomita drains to Machado Lake and ultimately to the ocean. The  LA Stormwater Partners site  provides more information about the watershed, monitoring, and regional efforts. 
 Stormwater – Pollution Prevention Stormwater is water from rain that does not soak into the ground. It flows over paved areas like streets, sidewalks, and parking lots, as well as roofs and sloped lawns. As it flows, the stormwater collects and carries pollutants such as litter, pet waste, pesticides, fertilizers, and motor oil. This “toxic soup” then flows through a massive system of pipes and channels directly into our local waterways and the ocean. 
 How to prevent stormwater pollution: Vehicle Maintenance 
 “Tips for the Auto Mechanic” brochure : All used motor oil, filters, and other automotive fluids should be disposed of properly and should never be dumped on the ground, street, gutter, or storm drain. Do-It-Yourselfers (DIYers) that change their own oil are encouraged to dispose of used motor oil and filters at their nearest recycling center. For more information on used oil recycling, visit  www.calrecycle.ca.gov . 
 Household Hazardous Waste  
 “Proper Disposal of Household Hazardous Waste” brochure : Take unwanted household hazardous waste materials such as batteries, paints, and antifreeze to a Household Hazardous Waste collection center or event. For events and locations, call 1-888-CleanLA (1-888-253-2652) or visit  www.CleanLA.com . 
 Green Waste  
 “Tips for Landscape & Gardening” brochure : Use a broom instead of a hose to sweep garden clippings. Excess water from sprinklers or a garden hose can pick up pollutants and enter the storm drain. 
 Pet Waste 
 “Tips for Pet Care” brochure : Pick up pet waste. When pet waste is left on the ground, harmful bacteria can wash down the storm drain and into the ocean resulting in contaminated and closed beaches. 
 Pesticides/Fertilizers  
 “Responsible Pest Control” brochure : Use pesticides and fertilizers sparingly and never apply these chemicals before a rain event. 
 Home Improvement 
 “Projects Tips Home Improvement Projects” brochure : Building materials such as paint and construction debris should be kept covered and away from the street, gutter, or storm drain. 
 What is the difference between the storm drain system and the sanitary sewer system? 
 The storm drain system and sanitary sewer system are both large conveyance systems of underground pipes. This leads to the misconception that the systems are one and the same. They are in fact separate and serve different purposes. 
 The sanitary sewer system transports domestic sewage to a treatment plant. Domestic sewage includes wastewater from household and commercial plumbing, such as toilets, showers, and sinks. In Lomita, sewage travels from private plumbing pipes into the City’s sanitary sewer system, which eventually carries it to the Joint Water Pollution Control Plant in the City of Carson. There, contaminants are removed from the sewage through a multi-stage process, which includes settling, filtering, and biological and chemical treatment. The treated water is then discharged into local waterways or used as reclaimed water. 
 The storm drain system, on the other hand, was designed to prevent cities from flooding. Its purpose is to quickly transport rain runoff (stormwater) away from the city and into the nearest waterway, without treatment. And so, any pollution carried by stormwater also enters our waterways untreated. 
 
 Where does our stormwater go? In the City of Lomita, stormwater enters the local storm drain system, which drains primarily to Machado Lake, but also into Los Angeles Harbor. What are the effects of stormwater pollution? 
 Stormwater pollution can have an adverse impact on our community’s health and environment as well as its local waterways and the ocean. 
 Health and Environment 
 Stormwater pollution poses a health threat to people who swim or fish in the ocean. The high amount of bacteria that a rain event may introduce into the ocean can cause beach closures. This impacts recreational uses for the ocean and our local waterways, such as swimming, beach tourism, fishing, and boating. 
Stormwater pollution can be toxic to marine life in the ocean and our waterways. Toxic pollutants can also be passed along the food chain. This can result in the contamination of locally caught seafood, making it unsafe for consumption. 
 Local Community 
 Local storm drains clogged with litter and debris can impact the local community. These “nests” of trash and debris can attract pests and rodents, create foul odors, clog the storm drain system, and cause flooding. In addition, clogged catch basins are unsightly and can affect neighborhood aesthetics and property values. 
 Illegal Dumping and Spill Reporting Hotline To report illegal dumping or a spill, please call either the City’s Public Works Department or Code Enforcement Officer at (310)325-7110 or the Los Angeles County 24-Hour Water Pollution Reporting Hotline at 1-888-CLEAN-LA (1-888-253-2652)

 An Annual Comprehensive Financial Report is a set of financial statements for a state, municipality or other governmental entity that comply with the accounting requirements established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). It must be audited by an independent auditor using generally accepted government auditing standards. ​​ 
​ 
​The Annual Comprehensive Financial Report consists of three sections: Introductory, Financial and Statistical. 
 The Introductory section orients and guides the reader through the report. The Financial section presents the entity’s basic financial statements as well as notes to the statements and the independent auditors’ report. The Statistical section provides additional financial and statistical data, including data about financial trends that may better inform the reader about the government’s activities. 
​ 
​Since 2004 the City of Lomita has received the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting for our Annual Comprehensive Financial Report.​​​​ 
​ 
​The GFOA established the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting Program (Annual Comprehensive Financial Report Program) in 1945 to encourage and assist state and local governments to go beyond the minimum requirements of generally accepted accounting principles to prepare annual comprehensive financial reports that evidence the spirit of transparency and full disclosure and then to recognize individual governments that succeed in achieving that goal.​​ 
​ 
​The Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA), founded in 1906, represents public finance officials throughout the United States and Canada. GFOA’s mission is to advance excellence in public finance.

 Animal Care and Control Sara Madsen 2023-05-23T19:13:40-07:00 
 
 The City of Lomita partners with the County of Los Angeles Department of Animal Care and Control (DACC) to address animal services for our City. 
 DACC provides the following services: pet adoptions, pet license renewal, stray sheltering services, animal facility licensing, and microchip registration. DACC is one of the largest and most progressive animal control agencies in the United States and provides animal services for the City of Lomita from their Castaic Animal Care Center location. 
 Through our partnership with DACC, the residents of Lomita receive these benefits: 
 
 Pet License Management:  All dogs and cats in the City of Lomita must be licensed. Please visit the website of our partner, County of Los Angeles Department of Animal Care & Control, website to  learn more about how to license your pet(s) or to apply for a license online . 
 Trained Animal Care Officers  (ACOs) that protect communities from dangerous animals, rescue sick or injured animals, investigate animal cruelty, remove deceased animals from public areas, reunite lost pets with owners and enforce local animal ordinances. 
 Lost Pet: The DACC “ If You Lost Your Pet ” page has various resources and tips for locating your lost pets! 
 Found A Pet: DACC provides resources and tips on  what you can do if you find a pet . 
 Adoption via countywide animal care centers  that shelter animals for adoption. Most of our animals are either strays or pets turned in by owners who are no longer able to keep them. The many benefits of adopting from a County Animal Care Center include low‑cost spaying/neutering, a free veterinary checkup, the peace of mind knowing that your new pet has received its initial vaccinations against contagious diseases, and the satisfaction of having saved the life of a shelter animal. 
 Community Outreach  via vaccination, microchip, and spay/neuter events. 
 Emergency Response and Assistance : Southern California is subject to many types of natural disasters such as wildfires, earthquakes, and floods. Local emergencies such as power outages, chemical spills, or other events can also disrupt normal activities. Being prepared for these situations will help you protect your pet. The Department of Animal Care and Control is prepared to respond to most disasters within our service areas. We have Mutual Assistance Agreements with other animal care and control agencies within and outside of Los Angeles County.

 Wildlife is handled differently, as the California Department of Fish and Wildlife does not allow the relocation of wild animals. 
 Helpful Tips Related to Coyotes The City would like to pass along these tips to minimize the potential of coyotes entering Lomita looking for food. 
 The County of Los Angeles Animal Care and Control has curtailed certain non-main mission services, including the routine response to calls involving “nuisance” wildlife. As such, the Department will no longer respond to calls regarding trapping or attempting to capture wildlife within Lomita including skunks, opossums, raccoons, and squirrels. The Department will continue to respond to such calls if it involves a public safety issue (such as rattlesnakes) or a sick or injured animal that requires humane removal. The standard turnaround time for these requests is within 24 hours, but the target time is within 4 hours. 
 The California Department of Fish and Game prohibits the Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control from relocating any wild animal. If a resident traps an animal, they must contact a private trapping service to remove and relocate the animal. Some trapping services may also be licensed to euthanize the wild animal in a humane manner. The following tips may be useful in preventing wild animals from foraging for food in your yard or surrounding area: 
 
 Skunks, raccoons and opossums are nocturnal or nighttime active animals and are often attracted to residential areas by the availability of food, water and shelter. 
 Removing or eliminating the availability of these elements will often encourage these wild animals to leave. 
 Remove unused pet food and water bowls at night. 
 Keep tight fitting lids on garbage cans or store garbage inside a secure area. Do not store trash in trash bags. 
 Gardens should be harvested frequently and windfall fruit picked up. 
 Keep pet access doors locked. 
 Seal up entry holes in and under buildings, eaves, air ducts and decks. Slotted metal vent covers are preferable to screen wire in keeping wild animals from entering houses through foundation vents. Backyard decks have proven to be extremely attractive shelters for wild animals. They may be excluded by using ¼” grid screening or solid metal flashing. Trench around the perimeter of the deck a minimum of 12 inches deep, insert screening in trench and backfill. Attach top of screening to facade of deck with nails or fence post staples. This technique may also be used along fence lines to prevent wild animals from entering yards or gardens. Before completing final seal on the last entry point on a building or deck, it is wise to make sure no animals are trapped inside. Sprinkle flour around the entrance holes and check for tracks the following morning. If no tracks are evident for 3 consecutive nights, no animals are likely present. 
 Wild animals causing lawn and turf damage may be encouraged to leave by controlling grub worms and other subsoil insects. Chemicals to control these insects may be obtained at hardware or garden supply stores. Remember the safety of your pets when dealing with chemicals. 
 Wild animals may be kept away from roof areas by trimming tree branches 10 feet from roof and by keeping climbing plants trimmed away from roof area and eaves. 
 Food and water should never be intentionally left out for wild animals.

 Organics Recycling is Changing in Lomita! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Organics Recycling is Changing in Lomita! Sara Madsen 2024-04-15T12:23:30-07:00 
 
 Residents across California will soon see changes to the way organic materials, such as food scraps and yard trimmings, are disposed of and recycled. SB 1383, a statewide effort to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, will require all California cities, including Lomita, to reduce organic waste and recover surplus food to feed Californians facing food insecurity. 
 This means there will be some changes in how we ask our residents to sort their organic waste, and in how our City’s waste hauler, Athens Services, collects and processes organic materials. During this period of transition, we appreciate our community’s cooperation and dedication to our City’s goal of creating a more sustainable future for generations to come. 
 Starting on January 1, 2024 all residents and businesses in California including Lomita will be required to recycle their organic waste. Organic waste includes food scraps, food-soiled paper and green waste. 
 What does this mean for you? 
 The City of Lomita is partnering with our waste hauler, Athens Services, which will provide safe and reliable curbside collection services for residents and businesses, including you! For residents, you will simply dispose of your organic waste in your existing green waste bin. 
 
 
 Help Be the Change! 
 When organic materials such as food scraps, yard trimmings, and paper break down in a landfill, they contribute to climate change. Because these materials decompose anaerobically (without oxygen) in a landfill, they produce methane, which is one of the most potent greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and a major contributor to climate change. 
 In an effort to protect the environment and reduce methane emissions, the State is requiring cities, like Lomita, to increase the diversion of organic materials  away  from landfills and  toward  the production of value-added products such as fertilizers, compost, and biofuels. The simplest way to accomplish this is to separate out organic waste from the rest of our trash, the same way we do with recyclable materials. This allows our waste hauler to repurpose these materials into mulch, compost, healthy soil, and other materials that help, not harm, our environment. 
 One of the most powerful things you can do to help California adapt to a changing climate is to use compost and mulch produced in California to sequester, or reuse, carbon in the soil – giving your organic waste a second life and purpose.

 What is organic waste? Sara Madsen 2021-11-09T23:35:57-08:00 What is organic waste? Organic waste is any material that is biodegradable and comes from either a plant or an animal. Biodegradable waste is organic material that can be broken into carbon dioxide, methane, or simple organic molecules. 
 What items are considered organic waste and acceptable for the green waste bin? Sara Madsen 2022-12-17T00:23:10-08:00 What items are considered organic waste and acceptable for the green waste bin? 
 Green Waste

 Why are the requirements changing? Sara Madsen 2021-11-09T23:37:52-08:00 Why are the requirements changing? A focus on recycling organic materials is central to California’s efforts to combat climate change. California has been experiencing the effects of a climate crisis: hotter summers, extreme temperatures, an increase in wildfires, extreme droughts, and rising sea levels that erode our coastlines. Research has taught us that greenhouse gases released by human activities, such as landfilling food and yard waste, contribute to climate change. To respond to this climate crisis, California is implementing statewide organic waste recycling and surplus food recovery. 
 Who do these new requirements apply to? Sara Madsen 2021-11-09T23:38:18-08:00 Who do these new requirements apply to? Everybody, including you! If you live, work, or own property in the State of California, you will need to take part in these new processes. 
 How do I participate? Sara Madsen 2021-11-09T23:41:12-08:00 How do I participate? Residents 
 What are my responsibilities as a resident? 
 
 Residents will simply dispose of organic/compostable waste in your existing green waste bin. 
 Investing in a kitchen trash bin used specifically for organics is recommended and will make this process easy. 
 
 Businesses 
 What are my responsibilities as a business? 
 
 Any business with 2 cubic yards of trash or more weekly is required to recycle organics and food waste. 
 Food service businesses must donate edible food to food recovery organizations with others starting in 2024. This will help feed the almost 1 in 4 Californians without enough to eat. 
 California has a goal to redirect 20% of edible food currently thrown away to people in need by 2025. 
 
 Self-Haulers (contractors, construction workers, landscapers, etc.) 
 What are my responsibilities as a self-hauler? 
 
 Self-haulers will need to ensure all organic compostable materials — such as hedge and tree trimmings, cardboards, wood scraps, etc. — are separated from landfill materials and properly disposed of. 
 
 Where will organic waste go? Sara Madsen 2021-11-09T23:41:42-08:00 Where will organic waste go? As California collects and recycles organic materials, local governments will be required to use the products made from this recycled organic material, such as renewable energy, compost, and mulch. 
 For example, organic waste will be used to curate healthy soil! Compost is a key to healthy soil, and healthy soil is critical to reducing carbon in the air. 
 Where will recovered surplus edible food go? Sara Madsen 2022-03-10T20:34:23-08:00 Where will recovered surplus edible food go? Recovered surplus edible food will be donated to food banks, homeless shelters, and other organizations for those who are food insecure. Starting in 2022, food service businesses must donate edible food to food recovery organizations. This will help feed the almost 1 in 4 Californians without enough to eat. California has a 2025 goal to redirect to people in need 20% of edible food currently thrown away. 
 Am I required to participate? What if I don’t change anything about how I take out my trash? Sara Madsen 2021-11-09T23:43:04-08:00 Am I required to participate? What if I don’t change anything about how I take out my trash? Yes! This is a new system similar to how your trash is picked up now. Everyone will need to participate and properly sort discarded materials into the correct bins or receptacles provided. 
 If you choose not to participate, you may receive a fine similar to if you don’t dispose of your regular trash properly. 
 The enforcement provisions in SB 1383 will assist jurisdictions, non-local entities, local education districts, state, federal facilities, and CalRecycle to achieve the state’s climate goals and the 75 percent organic waste diversion goal by 2025 and into the future. More information on enforcement rollout are forthcoming. 
 What if I don’t have the right resources? Sara Madsen 2021-11-09T23:43:40-08:00 What if I don’t have the right resources? The City of Lomita will provide resources to all residents and businesses. 
 Starting in 2022, all jurisdictions will need to provide organic waste collection services to all residents and businesses and facilitate the recycling of these organic materials through their hauler. 
 Will this mandate be enforced? Sara Madsen 2021-11-09T23:44:16-08:00 Will this mandate be enforced? The enforcement provisions in SB 1383 will assist jurisdictions, non-local entities, local education districts, state, federal facilities, and CalRecycle to achieve the state’s climate goals and the 75 percent organic waste diversion goal by 2025 and into the future. More information on enforcement rollout is forthcoming.

 The purpose of the City’s Capital Improvement Project (CIP) is to identify projects and funding sources, to strategically plan and prioritize projects within a budget to maximize the efficient use of funds and to preserve existing publicly-owned property and infrastructure. The City Council adopted the 5 year CIP program in June 2022. 
 Click below to see all City Council approved documents related to the CIP plan. 
 CIP Plan Documents 
 The links below include the City Council staff report dated June 2022, the powerpoint presentation from that same meeting and the CIP plan itself.

 Over the past year, several important projects have been completed, focusing on streets, parks, water infrastructure and public safety enhancements. The City is also in the analysis, design and construction phase for a number of projects. Click the map below to learn more! 
 Projects in the planning phase are attached to green buttons, projects under construction are attached to yellow buttons and completed projects are attached to blue buttons. 
     Pavement Management Program The City most recently completed its Pavement Management Program update in March 2024. A Pavement Management Program (PMP) is a planning tool to track the past, present and future pavement conditions and street maintenance and rehabilitation projects in a central database, utilizing engineering software to forecast pavement maintenance needs and assist in budgeting for street maintenance. The PMP ensures that the City is prioritizing roadway repairs to best serve the community in a cost effective manner. Per the PMP, the City’s street conditions are measured according to its Pavement Condition Index (PCI). The City has completed a number of street improvement projects over the past 3 years. Due to these improvements, the City’s overall street condition network has improved since the last PMP in 2017 which demonstrates the City’s commitment to improving street pavement conditions. The table below shows the improvement in PCI since 2011.

 Lomita Defines Distance Parked Vehicles Must Move Every Three Days 
 The City Council approved Ordinance No. 859 that defines the distance a vehicle should move following a 72-hour parking notice. California law authorizes cities to tow any vehicle that is parked on a public street for 72 or more consecutive hours to address the number of abandoned vehicles left on the roadway. Equally important, it is a valuable tool used by parking enforcement agencies to make reasonable efforts to provide equal access to street parking for everyone, particularly in areas of the community where parking is at a high premium. 
 Given the size of the city, the ordinance provides clarity and defines 100 feet (approximately the length of six standard vehicles) as the distance a vehicle must move following a notice of 72-hours of consecutive non-movement in Lomita. The vehicle could also move across the street or around the corner to be considered in compliance. This distance would make enforcement efforts more effective, particularly when addressing oversized vehicles that create safety hazards. Oversized vehicles can impede the visibility of traffic signals and signage, interfere with the follow of traffic on narrow streets, and compromise the safety for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists. 
 Enforcement of the ordinance began on February 15, 2024. There are no ticket fees attached to the 72-hour parking warning, however vehicles are subject to being towed by Lomita Sheriff.

 Public Records Requests Kalee Cummings 2021-10-21T21:21:08-07:00 
 
 The City Clerk, acting as the official custodian of records for the City of Lomita, accepts requests for public records and coordinates with appropriate departments to make sure all requests are provided within the legal time frame. 
 Please note, requests too general in nature, i.e., “all files relating to”, etc. may result in a delay pending further clarification of the records requested. Examples of information that may expedite the process: Name or title of the document, i.e., Resolution 2012-13; an address or property location; developer name; and/or date of Council/Planning Commission action. 
 There is no charge for electronic copies. However, a hard copy printout will cost $.10 per page, which will be billed in advance.

 Welcome to Lomita! We are pleased that you are becoming a part of our Lomita business community and we wish you much success. Taxes and fees collected as part of the Business License program help fund essential services in the City. The Business License Division is responsible for levying and collecting taxes, fees, and other assessments as well as licensing and permitting all businesses throughout the City. Clarification and definitions can be found in the Lomita Municipal Code, Title VI. 
 Title VI of the Lomita Municipal Code (Business, Professions and Trades) establishes business license rules and regulations within the City. As defined in Section 6-1.03 of the LMC, Businesses, professions and trades shall mean the conducting, carrying on, managing or operating of any purposeful activity, whether legal or illegal, profitable or unprofitable, intended to generate revenue, whether or not said business, profession or trade has a fixed place of business in the city. 
 In addition, the business license law shall apply to all persons conducting a business, profession or trade within the city whether or not such person maintains a fixed place of business in the city and whether or not such person may primarily conduct his business, profession or trade elsewhere. 
 For those businesses involving animals, the City of Lomita has contracted with the County of Los Angeles Department of Animal Care & Control to ensure that animals are cared for properly in animal-related businesses. These trained Animal Control officers inspect and grade dog and cat boarding facilities, pet shops, grooming parlors, animal menageries, non-profit humane organizations, animal training facilities, rooster facilities, animal exhibition events and mobile groomers. They also inspect businesses with guard dogs and establishments that require a conditional use permit. Letter grades are given to each business similar to the County’s restaurant grading system. Please see DACC’s information on facility licensing  here . 
 How to Apply for a Business License We’ve Gone Digital! 
 All steps of the business license application process can now be completed online. 
 Start Your Application What to Expect 
 As you move through the application process, you will be prompted to provide different information based on your answers to the application questions. All applicants are required to complete the zoning verification and the storm water form. Depending on your business, you may also be required to attach the following documents: driver’s license, Articles of Incorporation, Fictitious Business Statement, Resale License/Seller’s Permit, and applicable state licenses. 
 Questions 
 If you require assistance or have any questions, please contact the Business License Division (310) 325-7110 extension 137.

 × Demonstration Garden 
 Located just southeast of the Lomita City Hall building and adjacent to the parking lot is the Demonstration Garden. The City’s Demonstration Garden was constructed with a grant from West Basin Municipal Water District and the use of matching city funds. The goal for the garden is to show a redesigned landscape utilizing efficient irrigation and drought tolerant plants in order to reduce water use and eliminate run-off. This garden has reduced water usage by over 70% and features plant identification signs for each type of plant. These plants are affordable and readily available at local nurseries. 
 Located across the street from the Lomita Railroad Museum, this 0.17 acre passive open space area contains two box car displays, picnic tables and park bench.

 Close × Louis and William J. Teuchert Park 
 The City’s newest park Louis and William J. Teuchert Park was dedicated on April 25, 2017. Teuchert Park was made possible by the generous donation of Louis Teuchert, a long-time Lomita resident and a park grant from the LA County Park and Open Space District. 
 History of Teuchert Park 
 This all began in 2012 when Louis Teuchert contacted the City with an interest in donating this property to the City as part of his will. His original vision was to have this land utilized for a park or museum. Former Lomita Councilmember Jim Cole was instrumental in speaking with Louis at that time to ensure that his dream and wishes could become a reality. 
 Teuchert Park is also named in honor or Louis’ brother, Private First Class William Joseph Teuchert. William lost his life during the Korean War on August 27, 1951. This occurred during an almost 3 week battle where the Americans claimed a 2 mile by 3 mile area known as Bloody Ridge. Our side sustained 2,700 casualties. There were also an estimated 15,000 communist casualties. We can never thank them enough for what they have given, but we hope that this park stands as a reminder of the sacrifice and service of men like the Teuchert brothers.

 On December 21, 2021, the City Council adopted the Housing Element for the next eight-year planning period (2021-2029), as required by state law. On January 11, 2022, the adopted Housing Element was submitted to the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for a mandatory 60-day review. On March 11, 2022, the City received a letter from HCD with comments and has since revised the Housing Element to be responsive.  See Resources to view the  HCD comment letter and the Housing Element project timeline. 
 Click here  to review the Certified Housing Element  (October 14, 2022)  in response to the HCD Comment Letter. 
 The City greatly appreciates the community’s continued participation and engagement in this challenging and unprecedented update process. As Lomita is required to plan for a significant increase in housing and population, there is a strong commitment to promote new in-fill developments that support community-serving businesses and a variety of housing types. The City’s Housing Element acknowledges the need for policies and programs that provide for the growth of the community with purpose.

 New 3-Brushed Approach to Graffiti Abatement in Lomita 
 
 The City of Lomita is dedicated to the improvement of our community through measures that combat vandalism while also promoting artistic expression and beauty. Our city features many large, blank walls, or “blank canvases”, that can be enticing to vandals. Visible signs of disorder such as graffiti within a community may perpetuate and exacerbate harmful conduct. More formal covering of “blank canvases” through design strategies such as murals can help to ensure that we are not only ridding our city of graffiti, but also promoting beauty through creative expression. In order to ensure that we are striving towards this mission, we have developed a “3-Brushed” approach to protect your “blank canvas” from graffiti: 
 
 Cover Your Canvas [ideas for property owners to prevent graffiti] 
 
 Graffiti-resistant coating:  Various types of coatings chemically designed to protect surfaces from graffiti are available for purchase at hardware stores, home improvement stores, and Amazon. 
 Install lighting:  Proper lighting can deter graffiti artists as it may be easier to complete a tagging in a poorly lit area. 
 Install security cameras: Security cameras may help to identify vandals, which decreases the likelihood of future graffiti. 
 Buffer physical access to the canvas with landscaping:  Enhance your property with natural beauty such as bushes, hedges, and/or flowers near walls to create a physical buffer that inhibits artist access. 
 Plant trees:  Planting trees in front of blank walls can make it more difficult to access and tag walls. Trees also limit visibility of any tagging on the walls, making the location less desired by graffiti artists. 
 Cover with wall vegetation:  Ivy and other similar vegetation can physically prevent graffiti as it creates a natural plant barrier on the surface of the wall while also adding to aesthetic. 
 Add lattice or replace with a perforated design : Graffiti artists typically tag flat, seamless surfaces, so consider adding lattice work or a perforated design for enhanced dimension. This may include decorative punch-outs in walls or an additional perforated layer fastened to the wall. 
 Repaint with a multicolor pattern or mural:  Graffiti is more visible when a wall is painted using one color, so it is best to include patterns with diverse and alternating colors to deter tagging. Murals are permitted and encouraged within Lomita with Planning Commission approval. Look for a few popping up this winter and spring around Downtown Lomita! Please reach out to the Lomita Planning Division for more information at  dutyplanner@lomitacity.com  or 310-325-7110.  Staff is working on a resolution to reduce fees associated with mural approvals to be considered by City Council in early 2024. 
 
 
 Care For Your Canvas [graffiti-related laws and measures available for its removal]
 Lomita Municipal Code maintains measures to protect all properties and prevent future graffiti.  You may report the identification of a code violation to  code@lomitacity.com  by phone at 310-325-7110, extension 156. 
 
 Penalty :  Any person who writes, sprays, scratches, or otherwise affixes graffiti on any real or personal property not his or her own is guilty of an infraction. 
 Graffiti & Minors : No person shall sell or give to a minor any aerosol container that is capable of defacing property.
 
 No minor shall purchase an aerosol container of paint that is capable of defacing property. 
 No minor shall possess an aerosol container for the purpose of defacing property while upon any public place. 
 No person, other than a parent or legal guardian, shall furnish a graffiti implement to a minor. 
 
 
 Required Signage : Businesses offering aerosol paint containers must post a sign stating: “Any person who maliciously defaces real or personal property with paint is guilty of vandalism which is punishable by fine, imprisonment or both.” 
 Graffiti-Related Materials : No person shall carry an aerosol container of paint while in any posted public facility. 
 Graffiti Removal: 
 
 Owners shall remove graffiti from private property within the amount of days indicated by notice, otherwise Code Enforcement must proceed with citations. 
 Permissive Removal:  If a property owner consents, the City may remove graffiti on behalf of the property owner subject to a fee. This form will soon be available on this webpage. 
 Public Nuisance:  If a property owner fails to remove graffiti or elect for Permissive Removal, the site may be declared a Public Nuisance, forcing removal. 
 
 
 
 
 Common Canvas: [education & artistic expression in real life!]
 Coming soon! City Staff has partnered with a local muralist to educate our youth regarding graffiti and is conducting a mural competition! The City recognizes that graffiti is often the product of not having a proper creative outlet. Through teaching students about the dangers of graffiti and providing them with the tools to beautify our city, we hope to prevent future vandalism. The mural will be unveiled in a location at Lomita Park as part of the Anti-Gang and Drug Free Walk early this summer.

 Public Safety and Traffic Commission (PSTC) 
 The PSTC shall meet and function as defined in Title 2, Chapter 12 of the Lomita Municipal Code. In the PSTC’s current capacity (2020), the Commission shall review matters and make recommendations to the City Council related to safety and traffic. Any changes in Duties and Responsibilities of the PSTC in the Municipal Code, shall be automatically incorporated in this policy. 
 Specific changes to street sweeping days and times shall be reviewed by the PSTC only if there is a public safety or traffic concern related to street sweeping.

 Message from the Lomita City Council 
 The Lomita City Council is thrilled to announce and celebrate the 60th anniversary of the friendly city, on June 30, 2024. This momentous occasion will be marked by a series of special events and activities through December 2025 that aim to engage and unite the entire community in commemorating the rich history and vibrant spirit of Lomita. 
 Throughout this celebratory period, residents and visitors alike can anticipate a diverse array of special activities taking place throughout the entire City of Lomita. The festivities are designed to appeal to people of all ages and backgrounds, fostering a sense of community and pride. Aside from the highly anticipated special events hosted by the city every year, there will be specific events that celebrate the city’s 60 th  birthday. 
 One of the highlighted events is the Founder’s Day festival extravaganza, promising a grand celebration that pays homage to the visionaries and pioneers who played a crucial role in the establishment of Lomita. The festivities will further highlight the anniversary with a lively and memorable parade that will wind its way through the entire city. This parade is envisioned to be a source of joy and entertainment for the entire community, creating lasting memories for all who participate. 
 To encourage community participation, the City Council has organized engaging competitions such as fun fact trivia on social media on Fridays, historical photo submissions, and a calendar drawing competition. These events provide opportunities for residents of all ages to contribute their creativity and showcase their talents, adding a personal touch to the commemoration of Lomita’s 60 years of existence. These items will potentially be included in the time capsule that is scheduled to be unearthed on July 4, 2026 after 50 years. 
 The City Council’s message reflects their commitment to ensuring that the 60th anniversary of Lomita is a time of joy, reflection, and community building. By incorporating a wide range of events and activities, the celebration aims to bring people together, fostering a sense of unity and appreciation for the unique history and identity of the City of Lomita.

 Ethics Regulations Kalee Cummings 2025-02-04T11:01:04-08:00 
 
 Political Reform Act – Government Code Section 87505 Compliance 
 Statement of Economic Interests The Political Reform Act of 1974 requires persons holding specified public offices to file disclosures of investments, real property interests, and income within specified periods of assuming or leaving office and annually while holding the office. Elected officials are required by State Law to file their Statements of Economic Interests – Form 700 with the City Clerk, who makes and retains a copy of each statement and forwards the original to the California Fair Political Practices Commission, which is the filing officer. 
 Every elected official and public employee who makes or influences governmental decisions is required to submit a Statement of Economic Interest, also known as the Form 700. The Form 700 provides transparency and ensures accountability in two ways: 
 
 It provides necessary information to the public about an official’s personal financial interests to ensure that officials are making decisions in the best interest of the public and not enhancing their personal finances. 
 It serves as a reminder to the public official of potential  conflicts of interest  so the official can abstain from making or participating in governmental decisions that are deemed conflicts of interest. 
 
 Copies of these statements may be obtained by visiting the City of Lomita City Clerk’s Office located at 24300 Narbonne Avenue, Lomita, CA 90717. 
 Campaign Disclosure Filings The Political Reform Act of 1974 (Act) requires the filing of specified statements, reports and other documents by public officials, whether elected or appointed. Assembly Bill No. 2151 (Gallagher) approved by the Governor of California on September 28, 2020, added Government Code § 84616 to the Act. Effective January 1, 2021, local governmental agencies are required to post campaign statements and reports on their agency’s website, within 72 hours of each applicable filing deadline – please see relevant code section below. 
 84616. 
 (a) Within 72 hours of each applicable filing deadline, a local government agency shall post on its internet website a copy of any statement, report, or other document required by Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 84100) that is filed with that agency in paper format. If the final day of the 72-hour period is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the period is extended to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday. Before posting, the local filing officer shall redact the street name and building number of the persons or entity representatives listed on any statement, report, or document, or any bank account number required to be disclosed by the filer. Providing a link on the agency’s internet website to the statement, report, or other document satisfies this subdivision. (b) A statement, report, or other document posted pursuant to this section shall be made available for four years from the date of the election associated with the filing. (Added by Stats. 2020, Ch. 214, Sec. 1. (AB 2151) Effective January 1, 2021.)

 Sand Bags Available for Lomita Residents at City Hall While Supplies Last 
 
 City Hall is taking proactive measures to ensure the safety of its residents by providing sandbags to mitigate the impact of potential flooding. We have established a sandbag distribution point for residents. These sandbags are readily available and can be obtained by community members to fortify their properties and protect against flooding during heavy rainfall or other adverse weather conditions. By offering this resource, the city demonstrates its commitment to the well-being and safety of its citizens, fostering a sense of preparedness and community resilience. 
 Lomita Renews Agreement with American Red Cross 
 The City of Lomita recently extended its partnership with the American Red Cross to redesignate the Tom Rico Center as an emergency shelter to be utilized in the event of an earthquake, flood, or other natural disaster. 
 Lomita was the first of the 14 cities in the South Bay to renew their shelter agreement with the Red Cross. Red Cross’s emergency shelters provide a cost-free place to stay for both Lomita and South Bay residents who were forced to evacuate their homes in the event of a local disaster. Services offered include food and water, first aid, mental health services and help reconnecting with loved ones. 
 In addition as part of our renewed partnership, American Red Cross will be hosting blood drives, “Sound the Alarm” free smoke detector installations, among other emergency preparedness activites in Lomita. Check our website  https://lomitacity.com/  under Upcoming Events for dates and additional information. 
 People can request their FREE smoke alarms from the Red Cross and/or volunteer at  https://www.redcross.org/ sound-the-alarm.html 
 The Tom Rico Center is located at 24428 Eshelman Avenue. For more information on how to be Red Cross ready for any disaster, visit  https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies.html.
